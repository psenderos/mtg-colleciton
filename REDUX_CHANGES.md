# Redux Implementation for MTG Collection App

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Redux Dependencies
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` - Modern Redux toolkit for state management
- `react-redux` - React bindings for Redux

### 2. Created Redux Store Structure
- `src/store/index.ts` - Main store configuration
- `src/store/searchSlice.ts` - Search state management slice
- `src/store/hooks.ts` - Typed Redux hooks for TypeScript

### 3. Updated Application Components

#### App.tsx
- Wrapped application with Redux Provider

#### CardSearchPage.tsx
- Converted from local state to Redux state management
- Search query, results, pagination, loading, and error states now persist in Redux
- Preserves search results when navigating away and back

#### CardDetailPage.tsx
- Changed navigation from `navigate(-1)` to `navigate('/')` 
- Now always returns to search page instead of previous browser history

#### Layout.tsx
- Added drawer navigation that clears search state
- When clicking "Card Search" from drawer, it navigates to empty search page

### 4. Fixed Tests
- Updated test files to work with Vitest instead of Jest
- Added Redux Provider wrapper to component tests
- Created comprehensive Redux state tests
- Fixed TypeScript linting issues

## Behavior Changes

### Before:
- "Back to Search" used browser history (`navigate(-1)`)
- Search state was lost when navigating between pages
- Changing card versions and pressing back would go to previous version

### After:
- "Back to Search" always goes to search page (`navigate('/')`)
- Search state persists in Redux store
- When returning from card details, previous search results are restored
- Drawer navigation clears search state for fresh start

## Test Coverage
- Redux state management (6 tests)
- Component rendering with Redux (2 tests)  
- Service layer tests (7 tests)
- Total: 15 tests passing

## Usage Flow Examples

1. **Search → Card → Version → Back**: 
   - Search "reanimate" → Select card → Change version → "Back to Search" → Shows "reanimate" results

2. **Drawer Navigation**:
   - Click "Card Search" from drawer → Shows empty search page

3. **State Persistence**:
   - Search results, query, pagination state all preserved in Redux store
